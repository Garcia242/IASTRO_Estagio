Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: Error in function boost::math::quadrature::exp_sinh<double>::integrate: The exp_sinh quadrature evaluated your function at a singular point and returned nan. Please ensure your function evaluates to a finite number over its entire domain. (in '/Users/guilhermegarcia/Desktop/IASTRO_Estagio/Modelo1/Model/cmb.stan', line 103, column 2 to column 80)
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
