Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: Error in function tanh_sinh<double>::integrate: The tanh_sinh quadrature found your function to be non-finite everywhere! Please check your function for singularities. (in '/Users/guilhermegarcia/Desktop/IASTRO_Estagio/Modelo1/Model/SNIA.stan', line 66, column 4 to column 103)
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
