Chain [3] Iteration: 300 / 1000 [ 30%]  (Warmup)
Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: Error in function tanh_sinh<double>::integrate: The tanh_sinh quadrature evaluated your function at a singular point and got nan. Please narrow the bounds of integration or check your function for singularities. (in '/Users/guilhermegarcia/Desktop/IASTRO_Estagio/Model2/Model/bao.stan', line 92, column 4 to column 135)
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
